# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

The pages folder in a React project typically contains React components that represent different pages or views of your application. Each page component corresponds to a specific route or section of your website. Here's a breakdown of what might come under the pages folder:

**************************************************************************************************************
|-- components/
|   |-- menu/
|       |-- Menu.tsx
|       |-- MenuItem.tsx
|       |-- MenuList.tsx
|       |-- MenuCategory.tsx
The Menu folder in a React project, as per your structure, is likely meant to organize components related to displaying and managing the restaurant menu. Here's a breakdown of what might come under the Menu folder:

1. Menu.tsx:
This component could be the main container for rendering the entire menu. It may fetch data from the backend (using services from the services/ directory) and render different MenuCategory components.

2. MenuItem.tsx:
Represents a single menu item. It could receive data about a menu item (such as name, description, and price) as props and render it.

3. MenuList.tsx:
Responsible for rendering a list of MenuItem components. It could receive an array of menu items as props and map through them to render individual MenuItem components.

4. MenuCategory.tsx:
Represents a category or section of the menu, such as appetizers, main courses, or desserts. It could receive data about a category (name and associated menu items) as props and render a MenuList component.

By organizing your menu-related components in this way, you create a modular and reusable structure. Each component is responsible for a specific aspect of the menu, making it easier to manage and maintain your codebase. Additionally, this structure allows you to scale your application by easily adding new features or modifying existing ones related to the restaurant menu.

**************************************************************************************************************
1. We will manage all the routes via App.tsx (npm install react-router-dom)
(import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';)

2. Create Navigation Links:
Create Navigation Links: (example)
In our Header.tsx component, create navigation links using the Link component from React Router.

import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
const Header: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to="/about">About Us</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to="/menu">Menu</Link>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  );
};

export default Header;

The services folder and api.ts
1. logic and handle communication with the backend server. This organization is part of a pattern known as the "service layer" or "API services." The purpose of the services folder and api.ts file can include the following:

1. Abstraction of API Calls:
The api.ts file typically contains functions or classes responsible for making HTTP requests to your backend API. By centralizing these functions in one file, you create a clear abstraction layer for interacting with the server.

2. Separation of Concerns:
Keeping API-related logic in a separate folder helps maintain a clear separation of concerns in your project. Components responsible for rendering UI elements and managing state don't need to be cluttered with details about how to fetch or update data from the server.

3. Reusability:
Services can be reused across different components, promoting code reusability. If multiple components need to make similar API calls, they can all use the same service functions.

4. Modularity:
The services folder allows you to modularize your codebase. As your project grows, you may have multiple services for different parts of your application (e.g., user authentication, menu data retrieval, etc.).

5. Testing:
Separating API-related logic into a service layer makes it easier to write unit tests. You can mock or stub the service functions during testing without directly affecting the UI components.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// services/api.ts
import axios from 'axios';

const BASE_URL = 'https://api.example.com';

const api = {
  getMenu: async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get(`${BASE_URL}/menu`);
      return response.data;
    } catch (error) {
      throw error;
    }
  },
  // Other API functions can be added here
};

export default api;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// components/menu/Menu.tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import api from '../../services/api';

const Menu: React.FC = () => {
  const [menu, setMenu] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchMenu = async () => {
      try {
        const menuData = await api.getMenu();
        setMenu(menuData);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching menu:', error);
      }
    };

    fetchMenu();
  }, []);

  // Render menu components using the fetched data

  return <div>Menu Component</div>;
};

export default Menu;
